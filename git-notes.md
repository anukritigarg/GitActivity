### 1. What is a VCS and why is it needed?

Version Control software (VCS) helps in tracking and managing the changes that occurs while developing the software.

Needs:
Easy to keep track of version.
Compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake.
Developers can collaborate.

### 2.Whats is the difference between a forked repo and a cloned repo?

Forking a repo makes a copy of entire project/folder available on the remote repo i.e on github.
Cloning a repo makes a copy enture project/older available on our local system.

### 3.Why do we create branches?

Allows the developers to isloate their work from others and later merge it .
Keeps the code in the main branch clean and up-to-date.

### 4.What is the use of fork if we can create branches?

Forking creates a copy of an existing process which is independent of original repo even if the repo is deleted in future we will have a copy of it .All these are not possible in branch

### 5. What is the difference between staged and unstaged files?
Ans Staged files are those which are present in the staging area. These are the files which will be commited to the repository.
Unstaged files are those files which are not present in staging area that is git hasn't recorded it.

### 6. Difference between tracked and untracked files?
Ans Tracked files are those files which git has concern with.
Untracked files are those files which git doesnt know about.

### 7. How is git pull different from git fetch?
Ans Git pull is used when we wan to pull in any changes that have been made in the remote repo. Git fetch only brings the files to your system but doesnt merge it.

### 8. Why do we raise PRs?
Ans PRs are pull request.When we ahve made our changes and pushed it back into our repo. Click on Compare and pull request button or if it is not present then we can click on create new pull request and fill the required information that which is the base repo and what branch we want to pull.
## Answer's
9. We should always write commits in key-value pair where key will tell what we have changed and value will tell what feature or change we have done  and while name branches we can use the word fix and then give name to branches i.e fix/ branch name
10. git branch <branch name> and git checkout<new branch name>
11.git add remote add origin <URLfromgithub>
12.git status and git log
13.cd:-to change directory
  ls:-list files
  mkdir:-to make a directory
  14.by pull method
